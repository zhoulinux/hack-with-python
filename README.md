# hack-with-python

Learn hacking with python, inspired by How to Learn Hacking from ESR.

# Intro

I graduated with a bachelor degree in computer science and technology. But the fact is that I can't make something useful or interesting, using any programming language, which upsets me. In the last decade after leaving college, I tried several times to study programming, and I failed every time. So, as you can imagine, I lost my confidence.

Recently, I gain courage from the experience of learning something else, not because I am smarter than before, but more consistent. And I believe consistency is the last piece for my improvement in learning. Thank God, I believe God did all the miracles to me and changed me so much. On the National Holiday vacation, I read [How To Learn Hacking](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacking-howto.html)Â by Eric Steven Raymond, again. The method he introduces is wonderful, I believe. Now I am familiar with Python, one of the most beginner-friendly programming language. Then, I need to hack with Python, to enforce what I have learned.

When I search the internet, there are few resources for beginners like me, who are lack of knowledge, skill, and confidence. So I need more mini and small projects to help me keep programming.

With hard work, I found some pieces to start. And I decides to record all the steps I take while I learn hacking. I hope one day I will be able to make something interesting and useful.

So, this is the repository.

*By the way, I make these things on Mac, not testing on other OS.*
